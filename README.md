# ASL alphabet hangman

This game uses hand tracking to determine your guesses in hangman. Learn the ASL alphabet by playing our game!

This project uses Python and some libraries.

To play the game, run this program from a python IDE and have your webcam ready. Use your right hand to sign the letters of the alphabet.
Make your guess by holding the sign on screen long enough for the game to add your correct letter to the word, or to bring the hangman one step closer to death.

DISCLAIMER*** Please note that the list of possible words includes THE ENTIRE ENGLISH DICTIONNARY. That includes some profanity.
There is a very small chance that these words are randomly chosen to play the game; this does not reflect our ideals.
Thanks for understanding.


TL;DR - Bad words might show up, yikes
